This project shows how Docker helps run apps in isolated containers. I used Node.js for a web service and PostgreSQL as a database. I manually created a Docker network and linked the two containers.

I also added a creative touch by running multiple instances of the web service to simulate load balancing.

It was challenging but helped me understand Docker better, especially networking and volume management. In the future, I would add CI/CD and use Docker Compose for easier management.
